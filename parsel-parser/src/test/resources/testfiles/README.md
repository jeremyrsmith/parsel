This directory contains a selection of large-ish python files. Some are
purpose-written, and others are collected from GitHub and sometimes modified
to add additional exercises for the parser.

For test files that were adopted from open-source projects, the license of the
original file is included in a comment header. Any modifications for additional
exercise are marked with a `# PARSEL` comment.

If you've found some of your source code in this test suite, and you want it to
be removed, please make a PR which removes it, or contact the maintainers of
this project.
